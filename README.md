# Hack The Build

# The problem Honour solves
Well, knowledge is within every parts of the world then why restrict itself with languages. What we are suggesting is to make a web application which can convert the video to any language in run time. Users will have two option , either to upload a video or paste the video URL. Demo explains a lot about the problems and how it works.

# Challenges we ran into
Language translation is not easy and especially when you are not just using the API's. We have taken the reference of all the local dictionaries and NLP to match the text we have got from speech and improved it through our model. Second most important point was mapping the audio with video, because in video the narrator can take breaks so we also have to stop translating the model, and the third problem which is unsolved is the audio tone. We have to match the voice with the character's voice.
